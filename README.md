An implementation of the original ResNet architecture as outlined in the 2015 paper, Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. This pytorch implementation achieves a top-1 validation accuracy of 76.13% and a top-5 validation accuracy of 92.87% on the CIFAR-10 datasetâ€”within 3% of the author's reported results.
