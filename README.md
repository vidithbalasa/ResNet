An implementation of the original ResNet architecture as outlined in the 2015 paper, Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. This pytorch implementation achieves 92.13% test accuracy for resnet20 and 93.52% test accuracy for resnet50 on the CIFAR-10 datasetâ€”within 3% of the author's reported results.
